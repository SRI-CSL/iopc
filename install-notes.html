  <title>Installation Notes</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>The Pathway Logic Assistant (PLA) relies on several programs that must
be installed to use it. Below are instructions for obtaining those
programs that you don't already have. Followed by the very simple
instructions for installing and running PLA.  Hopefully you won't be
discouraged.   As PLA matures, installation will get simpler,
and once you have all the auxilliaries, updates will be easy!</p>

<h2>Maude</h2>

<p>Documentation and papers are available at <A HREF="http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu">http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu</a></p>

<p>Currently you need an Alpha release as some of the features needed
are not yet in the official release on the Maude website.
You can get Maude Alpha releases from the alpha release site 
<A HREF="http://www.csl.sri.com/~eker/Maude/">http://www.csl.sri.com/~eker/Maude/</a> using the following authentication:</p>

<p>
User Name: maudeabuser<br>
Password: bughunter
</p>

<p>Select the Alpha86a release directories.</p>

<p>Download
  <ul>
    <li>maude.&lt;platform&gt;  (linux or darwin)</li>
    <li>prelude.maude</li>
    <li>model-checker.maude</li>
  </ul>
and put them in one directory  (for example ~/Maude/bin/). Make sure that maude.&lt;platform&gt; is executable, e.g. by using this command
<pre>
  $> chmod a+x maude.&lt;platform&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>Set the MAUDE_LIB environment variable to include 
the directory where you put Maude and associated files.
For example, users running a csh or tcsh might add
<pre>
  setenv MAUDE_LIB ${HOME}/Maude/bin
</pre>
to their .cshrc file.  Users running sh or bash would use
<pre>
  export MAUDE_LIB=$HOME/Maude/bin
</pre>
in their .profile file.</p>

<p>
Caveat: in this release, 
your maude binary needs to retain the name maude.&lt;platform&gt;
for iop to find it.  If you want to call it maude, you can
define an alias, or make a symbolic link from maude to the actual
binary.
<p>

<h2>The IOP Platform</h2>

<p>Caveat, you will need Java 1.4.2 properly installed on your machine.
For Mac OSX this seems to be automagic.
For Linux maybe not.</p>
(If you have upgraded to Java 1.5, you will need to roll back for iop 
to work, i.e. put the path to Java 1.4 before Java 1.5 in your PATH
environment variable.)
<p>

<h3>1.) Download</h3>

<p>From <A HREF="PLresources/">PL resources directory</a>, download IOP-v&lt;number&gt;-&lt;platform&gt;.zip where &lt;platform&gt; matches your operating system.  Download the installer 
script <A HREF="PLresources/installer.pl">"installer.pl"</a> to the same location.</p>

<h3>2.) Environment Variables</h3>

<p>Before you run the installer you must set your IOBINDIR environment
variable to the path where you would like the binaries to go.
~/bin/IOP is a good choice.  Furthermore, IOPBINDIR must be
in your PATH environment variable.<p>

<h3>3.) Run installer</h3>

<p>Make sure that the installer script is executable.  To ensure this, you 
may run from the command line in the directory where you downloaded items
from step 1.)
<pre>
  $> chmod a+x installer.pl
</pre>
</p>

<p>Run the installer script from the command line (in the directory where 
you downloaded items) using this command
<pre>
  $> ./installer.pl
</pre>
and follow the instructions of the installer.</p>

<p>To test the installation (if you use tcsh, do "rehash" first), do from the command line
<pre>
  $> which iop
</pre>
which should print the location of the IOP installation.</p>

<h3>4.) Install "dot" </h3>

<p>For IOP to support PLA you need to have the GraphViz program dot
installed.  If you do not have dot already you can get dot only
by downloading one of these .zip files:
    <ul>
      <li><A HREF="PLresources/Dot4Linux.zip">Dot4Linux.zip</a></li>
      <li><A HREF="PLresources/Dot4Mac.zip">Dot4Mac.zip</a> (Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger)</li>
      <li><A HREF="PLresources/Dot4Panther.zip">Dot4Panther.zip</a> (Mac OS X 10.3 Panther)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Unzip and follow instructions in README.txt.
You need to have X11 installed as dot relies on some X11 libraries.
You can also install a proper GraphViz.  For Mac OS X, see 
<A HREF="PLresources/install-dot-mac.txt">install-dot-mac.txt</a>.  Or see the GraphViz
website: <A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org"> http://www.graphviz.org</a></p>

<h2>Pathway Logic Assistant</h2>

<h3>1.) Installation of PLA</h3>

<p>Download the file IPLA-v&lt;number&gt;.zip from the <A HREF="PLresources/">PL resources directory</a>.
In this file name, &lt;number&gt; denotes a version number.  Create a directory
~/Maude/Lib if you don't already have one.  Unzip the file in this directory,
which creates a new subdirectory called "IPLA".</p>

<h3>2.) Obtaining a model</h3>

<p>One or models will be available in  the PL resources directory. 
They can be recognized as zip files with names beginning with PL.
Download a file PL-&lt;model-id&gt;.zip, unzip this file anywhere you like. 
Unzipping will create a new subdirectory called "PL-&lt;model-id&gt;".</p>

<h3>3.) Running PLA</h3>

<p>To run PLA, change into one of your model folders and execute the shell
command "iop".  To suppress the InterOperability Platform console window
called  "GUI.Editor" use the following command:
<pre>
  $> iop -n
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The file PL-05Aug30-guide.txt in the PL resources directory
contains a guide for getting started with PLA in connection with
the model contained in PL-05Aug30.zip in that same directory.
</p>

<h3>4.) Customizing or writing your own model</h3>

<p>Download a model .zip file from the web page or create your own set of .maude files 
that constitute a valid Pathway Logic model.  As a minimum, you need the following 4 files:
<ul>
      <li>components.maude</li>
      <li>qq.maude</li>
      <li>rules.maude</li>
      <li>theops.maude</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Crucially, with the module QQ defined in qq.maude and including
the modules defined in the other files.</p>

<p>Make sure that you copy 2 files from the example model into your other model 
directories if they are not already included in the directory:
<ul>
      <li>startup.txt</li>
      <li>load-pla.maude</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Then, one can customize the model in your own PL directory by copying from the
example model and editing the file "predef-dishes.lsp" in a text editor.  
This file is used to initialize the menu items for predefined dishes in PLA. </p>

<p>Replace the predefined dish names with names of dishes in your  "qq.maude" 
file.  Be careful with spelling and capitalization!  E.g., if you have 
something like the following defined in your "qq.maude"
<pre>
  op hmec-model : -> Dish .
  eq hmec-model = PD(
  [...] )
</pre>
you may want to add the line
<pre>
  "hmec-model"
</pre>
(with the double quotes!) into the list of predefined dishes.  You may leave
the list of predefined dishes empty or choose to delete the file
predef-dishes.lsp altogether.</p>

<p>Finally, a file called "input.txt" in the model directory is used when
starting PLA with a console. This file is intended for expert users and can be
omitted.</p>
