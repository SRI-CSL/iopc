Treemanager for tabs too ...

What sort of ancestor relation are we interested in?  The graph child relationship, not the Frame child relationship.




Good time to incorporate preferences....


If toolbars belong to panes, how should jlambda add stuff to toolbars etc...
This actually may work if we keep global things global, and local things local.

global menu items:

File            Window
preferences     hide
close           zoom
quit            cascade
                "MWA tree view"


local menu items:

Exporting (as an image or graph)
Comparing (PNET ancestral hierarchy)
Graph


Toolbar pretty much constant, except that explore and compare window doesn't
have "Explore Subnet FindPath" buttons.

>>> Incorporate tabs into a mwa-like framework
=============================================

See if we can shrink the wasted space in the TabFrame too...

=============================================
MWA notes

Ditch Cascade  etc
Note that mwa titles are not that relevant in the tabbed world, so perhaps 
that part of mwa can be simplified.


=============================================

N.B. current system has an implict kb, which could be made explicit  AS PART OF pnet hierarchy.


two hierarchies: mwa and pnet geneology


tab <==> pnet ARE synonyms when the tab still exists!

root tab

unary tab constructions

binary tab constructions


to make a graph pnet need a static method  

createTab(parent, ......)

pnet family:
   --- dishnet
   --- subnet
   --- pathnet
   
cnet:
   --- comparenet 

xnet:
   --- explorenet aka XNet 


setGraph via a frame should GO


graphs should have zero or one tabs

and

tabs should have exactly one graphs 


if the parent is null then obvious thing is make this in a new frame.

if parent is not null, then new tab is adjacent to parent in same frame. what about focus???


Carolyn would like the tab/graph hierachy to be perpetual, killing a tab will
grey it out, but not delete it. And selecting a greyed out tab should 
relaunch it.




===============================================

launchTab(
        parentG,    //possibly null parent graph
        siblingG,   //new graph 
        )  

maybe then add arguments for customizing the toolbar and menubar

================================================

start with 

TabPanel launchTab(parentTab)
